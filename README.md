### Hi there 👋 I'm Alex
As far back as I can remember, I’ve always been curious about how things work—especially when it comes to technology. My journey into **cybersecurity** started with **web development**, which helped me bridge the gap between **coding** and **security**. But everything changed after my first **CTF** (Capture The Flag). I got hooked.

There’s something truly exciting about **uncovering vulnerabilities** and figuring out how to **mitigate them**—strengthening systems one step at a time. I'm constantly learning through:

- 🔐 **CTF challenges**
- 🛠️ **Hack The Box (HTB) seasons**
- 🧪 Researching and experimenting with tools
- 📚 Exploring new tech and security methodologies

---
### 🔧 [Raven Pulse](https://github.com/alexola/cyber)
**Cyber**  is a modular, menu-driven toolkit that I’m developing from scratch to learn, test, and apply real-world security concepts through code. It’s part of my journey to gain confidence in building **custom cybersecurity tools** and to contribute something meaningful to the community.
---
## 🛠️ Tech & Tools
- **Languages**: Python, JavaScript, Bash
- **Web Dev**: HTML, CSS, Node.js
- **Cybersecurity**: Burp Suite, Wireshark, Metasploit, Nmap, Gobuster, and more
- **Platforms**: Hack The Box, TryHackMe, CTFtime

---

## 🚀 Current Focus
- Diving deeper into **penetration testing**
- Building security scripts and automation tools
- Exploring red and blue team tactics
- Studying for industry certifications

---

## 🤝 Let's Connect
I'm always open to collaborating on security-focused projects or simply exchanging knowledge.
